### VLAN In GNS3


In GNS3, VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is used to create separate logical networks within a single physical network infrastructure.

VLAN has two ports one is trunk and another one is access.
1. An access port is a switch port that is configured to carry traffic for a single VLAN
2. A trunk port, on the other hand, is a switch port that is configured to carry traffic for multiple VLANs.
