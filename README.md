### VLAN In GNS3


In GNS3, VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is used to create separate logical networks within a single physical network infrastructure.<br>

The purpose of VLAN in GNS3 is to simulate the behavior of real-world networks and test the configuration of network devices in a virtual environment.

By configuring VLANs, network administrators can divide a single network into multiple virtual networks, each with its own VLAN ID, and isolate traffic between different VLANs. This allows for better network performance, security, and management.

In GNS3, VLANs can be created and configured on virtual switches, such as Cisco switches, which can be simulated using GNS3 software. Once VLANs are configured, virtual machines or other network devices can be connected to them to test the behavior of the network.

Overall, VLANs in GNS3 are an essential tool for network engineers and administrators to test and configure virtual networks in a safe and controlled environment before implementing them in the real world.


VLAN has two ports one is trunk and another one is access.
1. An access port is a switch port that is configured to carry traffic for a single VLAN
2. A trunk port, on the other hand, is a switch port that is configured to carry traffic for multiple VLANs.
