### VLAN In GNS3


In GNS3, VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is used to create separate logical networks within a single physical network infrastructure.<br>

The purpose of VLAN in GNS3 is to simulate the behavior of real-world networks and test the configuration of network devices in a virtual environment.

By configuring VLANs, network administrators can divide a single network into multiple virtual networks, each with its own VLAN ID, and isolate traffic between different VLANs. This allows for better network performance, security, and management.

In GNS3, VLANs can be created and configured on virtual switches, such as Cisco switches, which can be simulated using GNS3 software. Once VLANs are configured, virtual machines or other network devices can be connected to them to test the behavior of the network.

Overall, VLANs in GNS3 are an essential tool for network engineers and administrators to test and configure virtual networks in a safe and controlled environment before implementing them in the real world.


VLAN has two ports one is trunk and another one is access.
1. An access port is a switch port that is configured to carry traffic for a single VLAN
2. A trunk port, on the other hand, is a switch port that is configured to carry traffic for multiple VLANs. 

VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is needed for several reasons, including:

Security: VLANs provide an added layer of security to networks by separating and isolating different types of traffic. This can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and protect against network attacks.

Traffic Management: VLANs allow for the segregation of network traffic, enabling network administrators to prioritize certain types of traffic over others. This can help ensure that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth and performance, improving overall network performance.

Flexibility: VLANs allow for easy reconfiguration of network resources and can adapt to changing business requirements. This is particularly useful for organizations with dynamic environments that require frequent changes to their network infrastructure.

Scalability: VLANs can be used to break down larger networks into smaller, more manageable segments, making them easier to manage and maintain. This is particularly useful for larger organizations with complex network infrastructures.

Cost-Effective: VLANs can help reduce network infrastructure costs by enabling the sharing of physical resources, such as switches and routers, between different virtual networks.

Overall, VLANs provide a wide range of benefits that can help improve network performance, security, flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.
